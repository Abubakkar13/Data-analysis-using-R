# Create a scatterplot of price vs time.

# This will be an example of a time series plot.

# Resolve overplotting issues by using
# techniques you learned in Lesson 4.

# What are some things that you notice?

# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ================================================

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x=time, y=price, data=yo)
#scatter plot using qplot but you can also use ggplot
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x= time, y= price), data = yo) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/4, shape = 21, fill = I('#F79420'))
#geom_jitter is basically used to transparent the little lines here
```
