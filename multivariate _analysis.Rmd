#In this lesson we will learn how to analyze more than 2 variables from our data set

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = age), data = subset(facebookData, !is.na(gender))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 4)

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = subset(facebookData, !is.na(gender))) + 
   geom_line(aes(color= gender), stat = 'summary', fun.y = median)
#if you want to plot using colors then this is an nice example
```
