# Create a new variable called all.purchases,
# which gives the total counts of yogurt for
# each observation or household.

# One way to do this is using the transform
# function. You can look up the function transform
# and run the examples of code at the bottom of the
# documentation to figure out what it does.

# The transform function produces a data frame
# so if you use it then save the result to 'yo'!

# OR you can figure out another way to create the
# variable.

# DO NOT ALTER THE CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ========================================================
# ENTER YOUR CODE BELOW THIS LINE
# ========================================================


```{r}
#tranform can be used to combine the variables and create new variables based on prievous columns
yo <- transform(yo, all.purchases = yo$strawberry + yo$blueberry + yo$pina.colada + yo$plain + yo$mixed.berry)
# This is another way to accomplish what we did above. Here's the basic transform() syntax:
# dataFrame <- transform(dataFrame, newColumnName = some equation)
# So, to get the sum of two columns and store that into a new column with transform(), you would use code such as:
# dataFrame <- transform(dataFrame, newColumn = oldColumn1 + oldColumn2)
# To add a profit margin column to our data frame with transform() we'd use:
#   companiesData <- transform(companiesData, margin = (profit/revenue) * 100)
# We can then use the round() function to round the column results to one decimal place. Or, in one step, we can create a new column that's already rounded to one decimal place:
# companiesData <- transform(companiesData, margin = round((profit/revenue) * 100, 1))
# One brief aside about round(): You can use negative numbers for the second, "number of decimal places" argument. While round(73842.421, 1) will round to one decimal, in this case 73842.42, round(73842.421, -3) will round to the nearest thousand, in this case 74000
