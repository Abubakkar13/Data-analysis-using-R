```{r}
  ggplot(aes(x = friend_count, y = ..count../sum(..count..)), data = subset(facebook, !is.na(gender))) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = gender), binwidth=10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000), breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  xlab('Friend Count') +
  ylab('Percentage of users with that friend count')
```


Equivalent query in ggplot2 syntax 

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = www_likes), data = subset(facebook, !is.na(gender))) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = gender)) + 
  #scale_x_log10()
```
try running this program with scale_x_log10() and without it. If two graphs are overlapping to each other then you could use this scale_x_log10().


which gender group has more likes you need to find first
```{r}
by(facebook$www_likes, facebook$gender, sum)
```

We will use the by command 

```{r}


```
