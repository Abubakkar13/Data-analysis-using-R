Creating multiple graphs in one plot using gridExtra 
```{r}
p1 = qplot(x = friend_count, data = facebook) 
p2 = qplot(x= log10(friend_count), data= facebook)
p3 = qplot(x= sqrt(friend_count), data= facebook)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=1)
```
log10 and sqrt transformation helps use to see the data properly


if you want to use the ggplot to explore all the other functionalities
```{r}
library(gridExtra)
p1 <- ggplot(aes(x= friend_count), data=facebook) + geom_histogram()
p2 <- p1 + scale_x_log10()
p3 <- p1 + scale_y_sqrt()
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, ncol=1)
```
the syntax for ggplot is exactly similar but we have to define aes and also include geom_histogram (define what kind of histogram are you looking forward)
