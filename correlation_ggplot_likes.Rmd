```{r}
#this file will show the scatter plot of total likes received vs likes received
plot(x = facebookData$likes_received, y= facebookData$www_likes_received)
#rather then using this one , we can use ggplot 
```


```{r}
ggplot(aes(y = likes_received, x = www_likes_received), data=facebookData) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, quantile(facebookData$www_likes_received, 0.95)) +
  ylim(0, quantile(facebookData$likes_received, 0.95)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = 'red')
#if you are using ggplot then you need to include your data in aes wrapper
#including geom_point tells the ggplot that we are looking for only scatter plot
#you can use this geom_smooth method to 
#what do you think is the correlation between the two values 

#cor(facebookData$www_likes_received, facebookData$likes_received)
#for finding top 5% data you can use quantitle 

```
